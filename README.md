# EUROPEAN NREN BACKBONE NETWRORK. 
Simulation of a GEANT-style European NREN backbone with segregated R&amp;E, Internet, and LHCONE traffic using VLANs, dynamic routing, DHCP, NAT, and security controls.
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure small enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was built with scalability, segmentation, and security best practices in mind.

## Technologies & Concepts 
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLAN segmentation
- Inter-VLAN routing
- DHCP configuration
- IPv4 addressing with VLSM
- SSH secure device access
- Basic network hardening
  
## Network Objectives 
- Provide logical segmentation using VLANs
- Enable secure remote management via SSH
- Automatically assign IP addresses using DHCP
- Ensure reliable end-to-end IPv4 connectivity

The network consists of:
- 1 ISP router
- 4 Routers 
- 4 Switch
- 12 End devices (PC1, PC2, pc3)
- VLAN Groups:
- VLAN 10 - Internet Access Serivice (IAS) 
- VLAN 20 - Research and Education (RE)
- VLAN 30 - LHCONE (LHC) 

## Skills Demonstrated
- Enterprise network design methodology
- Practical Cisco device configuration
- Security-conscious networking
- Technical documentation & communication
- Troubleshooting and verification
